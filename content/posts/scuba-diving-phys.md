## Units and Conversion

- Litre: `l` (`1 l = 1 dm3`)
- Pressure unit: `bar`
- Pressure unit #2: Pound per square inch: `1 bar = 14.7 psi`
- Pressure unit #3: Pascal: `1 bar = 100 kPa` (kilopascals)
- Pressure unit #4: Atmosphere: `1 bar ~ 1 atm` (not equal, but considered equal for the purposes of diving)
- Pressure at surface (sea-level): `1 bar`
- Metre sea water: `10 bar = 1 msw`
- Partial pressure of oxygen: `ppO2`
  - `ppO2` greater than `1.6 bar` is considered **dangerous**!
- Fraction (percentage) of oxygen in a gas: `FO2`
- Partial pressure of nitrogen: `ppN2`
- Fraction (percentage) of nitrogen in a gas: `FN2`
- Density of fresh water: `1 kg / l`
- Density of salt water: `1.025 kg / l`
- Density of air (at `1 bar`): `0.0013 kg / l`

Relationship between units where `F02 = 21%` and `FN2 = 79%`:

| Depth [m / msw] | Ambient pressure [bar] | [ppO2] | [ppN2] | Volume | Density |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 0 (surface) | 1 | 0.21 | 0.79 | x | y |
| 10 | 2 | 0.42 | 1.58 | x/2 | 2y |
| 20 | 3 | 0.63 | 2.37 | x/3 | 3y |
| 30 | 4 | 0.84 | 3.16 | x/4 | 4y |
| 40 | 5 | 1.05 | 3.95 | x/5 | 5y |


## Buoyancy

_Buoyancy is the characteristic of a fluid to push up on an object immersed in it._

- Buoyancy of an object is closely related to its density and the density of the fluid it's immersed in.
- `B = V x d - W`
- Where: B - buoyant force (expressed in terms of weight), d - density of liquid, V - object volume, W - object weight.
- Positive buoyancy (floating, `B > 0`), object displaces more weight than it's own
  (object weighing less than `1.025 kg / l` floats in salt water).
- Negative buoyancy (sinking, `B < 0`), object displaces less weight than it's own
  (object weighing more than `1.025 kg / l` sinks in salt water).
- Neutral buoyancy (`B = 0`), object displaces approx. the same weight as it's own
  (object weighing `~1.025 kg / l` will remain neither sinking nor floating in salt water).

## The Big Four Laws of Physics

### Archimedes' Principle

_Any object immersed in a liquid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the volume of the liquid displaced by
the object._

### Boyle-Mariotte Law (Volume and Pressure Law)

_Under constant temperature conditions, the pressure and volume of any gas are inversely related._

- `P1 x V1 = P2 x V2`

### Dalton's Law

_In a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of partial pressures of individual
gases._

- `P = P1 + P2 + ... + Pn`

### Henry's Law

_At a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas that dissolves in a given type and volume of liquid is directly
proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid._

## Arbitrary Fun Facts

- With change of pressure, wetsuits compress and expand and create buoyancy changes due to the change in their volume.
- Water absorbs body heat `25-30` times faster than air.
- Most of the body heat escapes through head, feet and hands
  (hoods, gloves and boots account for `30%-40%` of thermal protection).
- Salt water diving requires `5%-10%` more additional weight.
- Proper position (attitude) underwater: `15` to `20` degrees.
- Aluminium tanks become positively buoyant when empty.
- Steel tanks remain negatively or become neutrally buoyant when empty.
- Sound travels `4` times faster underwater than through air.
- To the human eye, objects appear approx. `1/3` larger and `1/4` closer underwater than they really are.

## Exposure and Temperature

Recommended level of protection in a given temperature range:

| Suit | Temp. range °C |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Shorty | 25+ °C |
| Wetsuit 3 mm | 21 °C - 27 °C |
| Wetsuit 5 mm | 16 °C - 21 °C |
| Wetsuit 7 mm | 10 °C - 16 °C |
| Dry suit | 0 °C - 16 °C |
