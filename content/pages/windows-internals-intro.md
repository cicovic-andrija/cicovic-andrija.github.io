Summary of the initial chapter from "Windows Internals: Seventh Edition", by Mark Russinovich et al. Windows APIs,
process/thread control, virtual memory, firmware and other operating system concepts of the Windows OS can be studied
in great depth by reading this book (which I have once started and never finished). This post contains notes I took
when I started reading the book with the brief overview of all of areas covered across all chapters.

## Introduction

- **OneCore** - Converged kernel, drivers and other base binaries for all hardware platforms (PC, Xbox, IoT devices...);
  since Windows 10.

## APIs

- Native API (Native system services / system calls) - undocumented, underlying services in the OS that are callable
  from user-mode.
- Windows API - user-mode programming interface for Windows OS family (32-bit and 64-bit).
- Win32 API - Older name, for only the 32-bit Windows API.
- Component Object Model (COM) - a newer, more modern API for inter/in-binary component communication, in which COM
  clients communicate with *objects* (a.k.a. COM server objects) through interfaces, and interface implementations (COM
  servers) are loaded dynamically (from a .dll) rather than being statically linked to the client code.
- The Windows Runtime (WinRT) - new API introduced with Windows 8 for developing *Windows Apps* (a.k.a. *Metro Apps*),
  and is built on top of COM.
- .NET Framework - part of windows that consists of:
  - The Common Language Runtime (CLR) - runtime engine for .NET which includes a JIT compiler that translates
    Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instructions to the underlying CPU machine language; implemented as a COM
    in-process server (DLL).
  - The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) - large collection of types that implement common functions needed by client
    and server applications.

## Processes

- Program / process:
  - Program - static sequence of instructions.
  - Process - container for a set of resources needed to execute an instance of a program (virtual address space (VAS),
    executable binary (image) file, list of open handles, security context, process ID, thread(s)...).
- Each process is named by its executable image and has a unique process ID.
- Each process points to its parent process (may be, but is not always, its creator process).
- Parent process may no longer exist, and that's fine. Windows does not keep track of higher ancestors of the process,
  it can only trace back up the process tree if the parent process is still running.
- Process ID is part of an internal structure called Client ID.
- Security context is stored in an object called an *access token*.
- Virtual address descriptor (VAD) - used by the memory manager to keep track of the VAS.

## Threads

- Thread - an entity within a process that Windows schedules for execution.
- Essential components of a thread:
  - Contents of a set of CPU registers representing the state of the processor.
  - Two stacks - one for user-mode and one for kernel-mode.
  - Private storage area - *thread-local storage (TLS)* for use by subsystems, run-time libraries and DLLs.
  - Thread ID (never overlaps any process ID, they are generated from the same set).
  - Sometimes, thread's own security context.
- Thread ID is part of an internal structure called Client ID.
- Threads share the processes's virtual address space.
- Threads don't have an access token by default, but can obtain one.
- Registers and TLS constitute thread's context, which structure is architecture-specific.
- Fibers (lightweight threads), application can do the scheduling, implemented in user mode in kernel32.dll and
  **invisible to the kernel** (causing perf and sharing problems), can't run concurrently on more than one processor.
- User-mode scheduling (UMS threads) - only on 64-bit Win, visible to the kernel, can issue blocking syscalls, share and
  contend for resources, and switch context in user-mode without involving the kernel scheduler (because from kernel
  perspective, it's all still running on the same kernel thread). For kernel-mode operations (like syscalls) UMS thread
  switches to its dedicated kernel thread (*directed context switch*).

## Jobs

- Job (or a *job object*) - Windows's extension to the process model that allows managing and manipulation of groups of
  processes as a unit, and offers control of certain attributes and limits for the processes associated with the job.

## Virtual Memory

- Flat (linear) address space, that provides a logical view of a private memory space for processes.
- Pages of virtual address space are mapped by the OS's memory manager and hardware to the physical space.
- Default page size 4KB.
- On 32-bit x86 systems (4GB VAS), lower half of addresses are private to process, and upper half are OS's virtual
  addresses, although this can be changed up to 3GB for the process and 1GB for the OS. Mappings for the upper half are
  mostly the same for all processes because they map to the kernel-owned memory.
- On 32-bit x86 systems, AWE (Address Windowing Extensions) allows 32-bit programs to allocate up to 64GB of physical
  memory and map "windows" of it into its 2GB address space.
- On 64-bit systems, theoretical limit of the VAS is is 16EB, but 64-bit hardware limits VAS to smaller sizes.
  On Windows 8.1 and newer, 128TB is reserved for process's private use, and 128TB for OS use.

## Kernel-mode and User-mode

- Processors provide multiple execution modes (*ring levels* and similiar terminology).
- Windows uses two modes, and in Windows terminology, those are called user-mode and kernel-mode (usually they map to
  the highest and lowest privilege level modes available on the processor).
- In kernel-mode, OS runs its system services, drivers etc. and has access to all of memory and all processor
  instructions.
- Each page in virtual memory is tagged to indicate what mode the processor must be in to read/write the page. Since the
  code running in kernel-mode is running in the highest priviledge mode on the processor, every memory page is
  accessible.
- There are very strict security procedures (e.g. code signing) that drivers must go through, in order to be installed
  and loaded in the OS.
- When user-mode code executes a system call, a special processor instruction triggers the switch to kernel mode and
  calls a kernel-mode function to handle the call.
- Note: mode transition from user/kernel to kernel/user is not a thread context switch, it's a mode switch.

## Hypervisor

- Hypervisor - a specialized, highly priviledged component that allows for the virtualization and isolation of all
  resources on the machine (virtual/physical memory, device interrupts, PCI/USB devices etc.).
- Hyper-V - Windows's hypervisor solution.
- Hypervisor has greater access privileges than the kernel, and can provide a new set of security services for
  monitoring its instance(s), known as virtualization-based security (VBS).
- Virtual trust levels (VTLs) - Similar to processor priviledge levels; kernel and user mode exists within each VTL,
  but the hypervisor managed priviledges across VTLs.
- In hypervisor, kernel code is running in a less priviledged VTL than the VBS and other services the hypervisor is
  running, so even a kernel crash cannot affect the hypervisor.

## Firmware

- System firmware, which on certified systems must be based on UEFI, ensures the authenticity of boot-related software.
  Windows updates now also carry firmware updates.
- UEFI (www.uefi.org).
- Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

## Objects and Handles

- *Kernel object* - a run-time instance of an object type, with associated functions and state.
- Not all data structures in Windows are objects, only data that needs to be shared, protected, named or made visible to
  user-mode programs.
- Handle - a reference to an object.

## Security

- Core security capabilities of Windows:
  - Discretionary and mandatory protection for all shareable system objects.
  - Security auditing.
  - User authentication at logon.
  - Prevention of unauthorized or invalid access to system resources.
- Access control:
  - Discretionary access - owners of objects grant or deny access to others.
    - Improved further with attribute-based access control (a.k.a. Dynamic Access Control).
  - Privileged access control - ensure that an object can be accessed if its owner is not available.
  - Mandatory integrity control - protect objects that are being accessed from within the same user account.

## Registry

- Centralized system database: configuration for system bootstrap, system-wide software settings, the security database
  etc.

## Unicode

- Windows is different from other operating systems, because it uses 16-bit Unicode encoding, specifically UTF-16LE.
- Each Unicode character is encoded as a two-byte (16-bit) little-endian value.
- Many Windows functions that accept string parameters have two entry points: Unicode (wide/16-bit) and
  ANSI (narrow/8-bit) version; this is because many programs deal with 8-bit character strings.
- For example, CreateFile function from Windows API expands either to CreateFileA or CreateFileW, where A stands for
  ANSI, and W stands for wide (expansion is based on the compilation constant UNICODE).
