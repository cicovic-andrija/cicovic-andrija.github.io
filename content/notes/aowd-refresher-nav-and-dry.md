## Underwater Navigation

### Natural Navigation: Geographic Formations

- Walls, drop-offs, ledges, coral heads, rock formations, outcroppings, overhangs, kelp beds, bottom slope...
- Bottom composition changes during the dive.
- Sand ripples on the sandy bottom run parallel with the shoreline because of wave action.
- Back and forward wave motions (surge) is more noticeable near the shore and is _usually_ parallel to the shore.
- Current direction can also be used as a recognizable feature of direction.

### Natural Navigation: Landmarks

- Wrecks, docks, buoys, sunken anchors, lobster traps...

### Natural Navigation: Illumination

- Sun & light rays (early and late in the day), shadows, moon (night), strobes (night)...

### Natural Navigation: Planning

- Get in touch with someone familiar with the dive site.
- Plan the dive on the surface (draw a map or take notes).
- Pay attention to the pre-dive briefing.
- At the bottom, pay attention to the surroundings, water movement, depth, light rays...
- Once you realize you are lost, stop before you make yourself even more lost and review all of the clues from above.

### Compass

- Very useful in limited visibility underwater or on the surface (e.g. fog or cloud cover).
- **Trust the compass when diving, a sense of direction can be completely off!**
- Needle of a compass points to Magnetic North, not the True North of the Earth.
- The Magnetic North is ~1609 km south of the True North (only relevant when using a long/lat chart).
- Variations caused by Magnetic vs. True North is almost never relevant in diving.
- On a compass: N(orth) = 0°, E(ast) = 90°, S(outh) = 180°, W(est) = 270°.
- Metal objects like wrecks or mineral ore in the bottom can cause deviations when reading a compass.
- The compass should be fairly sensitive to quickly pick up any deviations from course.
- Compass components: magnetic needle, movable bezel, lubber line, index mark, reciprocal course mark (index+180°)...
- Direct reading compass: degree markings are on the movable bezel.
- Indirect reading compass: degree markins are on the housing and index mark is on the bezel.
- Compass should be washed in fresh water after every dive; it should be never stored in direct sunlight.
- When diving perpendicular to a longshore current, dive (slightly) left or right of the heading in order to
  end up at the desired destination.
- When shore diving, rip currents can take divers out to sea, but the exit point must be chosen away from
  the rip current, creating a situation when entry and exit points are different.
- Advanced methods exists for correcting current deviation of course during drift dives.
- For further research into navigation: _dead reckoning_.

## Cold Water Diving

### Dry Suit Materials and Features

- Compared to wetsuits: keeps diver warmer between dives, less interference with blood circulation, less restricted
  breathing, minimized heat loss, more expensive, more durable.
- Wetsuit divers are more likely candidates for decompression sickness than dry suit divers (due to changes in blood
  composition and _nitrogen trapping_).
- Common suit materials: closed cell neoprene, crushed neoprene, compressed neoprene, vulcanized rubber,
  try-butyl laminate material, nylon...
- Common dry suit features: dry zippers, attached dry boots, knee pads, (attached or separate with attachment ring) dry
  gloves, attached dry hoods, suspenders, ankle straps.
- Hoods, gloves and boots account for 30% to 40% of thermal protection.
- The key to correct fit in a dry suit is the length of the suit; if the suit is tight in the crotch, or it is difficult
  to squat or kneel, it is too short.
- Valves on the dry suit:
  - Inflator valve (usually on chest): similarly to the inflator on BCD, _low pressure_ inflator hose is attached,
    routed under the arm (or over a shoulder).
  - Exhaust valve (usually on upper arm) - three designs:
    - Manual exhaust valves: exhaust air only in upright position by using the pressure differential between the feet
      and the valve (spring loaded).
    - Manual power exhaust valves: integrated with the suit inflator, air from the inflator hose is used to create a
      suction and forcefully remove the air from the suit.
    - Automatic exhaust valves: exhaust air without any action needed from the diver at the highest point of the body
      (most have a spring loaded manual override).
- Continued pushing of the valve after all the air is exhausted may cause water to enter the dry suit.
- Valves are usually designed so that the inflator valve pumps air slower than exhaust valve vents it, to allow air
  to escape.

### Insulation

- True function of the dry suit is only to keep the diver dry; insulation (undergarmets) are responsible for warmth.
- Passive insulation: inside the dry suit, the insulation traps a layer of air that is warmed by the diver's body.
- Insulation must be adjusted to water temperature and activity level.
- Overheating in a dry suit is possible, uncomfortable, and dangerous.
- Different insulation materials get crushed more or less underwater, leaving less or more air in the suit.
- Lint from undergarments can jam the valves open or closed.
- Some insulators are better than others when they get wet, a point to think about when choosing insulation material.
- Argon gas can be used as added insulation (twice the insulation efficiency of compressed air, does not harm the suit);
  it is usually carried in a small tank with a first-stage and a low-pressure inflator hose for suit inflation.
- In Nitrox diving, O2-enriched air can cause material corrosion inside the dry suit over time.
- In cold water, nearly half of the body's heat is lost from the head because it has little insulation.
- Wetsuit divers have the urge to urinate more frequently than dry suit divers because of the body's reaction to
  heat loss.

### Dry Suit Diving Tips

- Proper weighting: at the beginning of the dive, the diver should have just enough weight to sink feet first after
  exhaling when all air has been vented from suit and BCD.
- The less air in the suit, the buoyancy control will be better - the minimal amount of air needed to avoid the squeeze
  should be in the suit.
- When ascending, avoid having to control both bladders of air (suit and BCD) at the same time.
- If the suit gets over-inflated, disconnect the inflator hose and vent the air, or as a last resort open the wrist seal
  to dump the air fast (lets the water in as well).
